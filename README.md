# HOT NFT

## HOT NFT is a farcaster frame that pulls trending NFTs

### HOT NFT aspires to be the primary interface to snipe hot NFTs

### Built by Saarim Zaman (@saarim on warpcast, @poolnoodle93 everywhere else)

### Built with NestJS and Typescript, hosted on Vercel

### As of now, the app is readonly and requires you to find the NFT. As Frames develop, I will add the ability to snipe NFTs from the frame itself.
